# FluentPocket

Based on https://github.com/yazdipour/pocketx, FluentPocket aims to be a very simple list of saved items in your Pocket.   
There's no Reading View (when you click an item it'll open your default browser) and there are no settings (the UI follows the system theme).  
The app has been updated to reflect the new Win 11 UI.  
  
You can only:  
-View your Saved, Archived, Favorited items  
-Edit tags  
-Add Items with tags  
-Search for items and tags  
-Share to the app to create an item   
  
There are a couple of fixes I need to implement, but I consider the app feature complete.  
  
Feel free to fork it and use it as you wish, and please donate to the original developer https://github.com/yazdipour/ which did a fantastic job.  
  
To instructions on how to build the app, please follow PocketX's readme file.
